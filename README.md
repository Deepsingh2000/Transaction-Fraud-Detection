## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at [Dataset Source](link-to-dataset). It contains transaction records with labeled fraud and non-fraud cases. The data preprocessing steps are detailed in the code to prepare it for model training.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

You can install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-transaction-prediction.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fraud-transaction-prediction
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `fraud_detection.py`: Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized Logistic Regression model after training.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Usage

Modify the `fraud_detection.py` script to fine-tune the model or adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements. Customize the code for your use case and data sources as needed.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Please refer to the code for specific evaluation details.
